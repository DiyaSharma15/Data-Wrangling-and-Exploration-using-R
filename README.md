# Data Wrangling and Exploration using R

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing salary data, involving various steps to clean, explore, and visualize the data effectively.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**
   - Loaded the dataset and inspected the first and last few records.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked for and addressed missing values.
   - Identified and removed duplicate records.
   - Converted data types to appropriate formats.
   - Removed unnecessary columns.

3. **Data Exploration**
   - Generated summary statistics to understand the dataset better.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Created scatter plots to visualize:
     - Total salary over the years.
     - Salary against years of experience.
     - Salary distribution by education level.
   - Combined multiple plots into a single view for comparative analysis.

5. **Map Visualization**
   - Prepared a dataset including minimum wage information by state.
   - Created a choropleth map to visualize minimum wage across the USA from 1968 to 2020.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my skills in data analysis and visualization, including data cleaning, statistical summarization, and creating insightful visualizations using R. It is a comprehensive showcase of my ability to handle and interpret complex datasets.
